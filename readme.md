# Socket.io-file-client
Socket.io-file-client is module for uploading file via Socket.io.


## Major Changes from 1.x to 2.x
Socket.io-file 1.x used Binary String to send files. Binary String is little bit slower than direct Binary writes, and also server used fs.write, not writable stream.
Recently, FileReader.readAsBinaryString() was deprecated, so I updated Socket.io-file to use ArrayBuffer(Object for manipulate Binary Data directly from JavaScript) instead of Binary String.

Also, newer version has much more functionalities, like Server-side MIME type checking, File size limitations.
Even you can configure the size of each transmission(chunk) any value you want, higher value gives you faster upload.


## Features
- Simple is the best.
- File uploads
- Highly improved performance
- Using File Streams to write faster, efficient.
- Checking mime, limit file size
- Multiple file uploads

## Install

```
 npm install socket.io-file-client --save
```

	<p>Multiple upload also supports.</p>

	<form id="form">
		<input type="file" id="file" multiple />
		<input type="submit" value="Upload" />

```javascript
var socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
var uploader = new SocketIOFileClient(socket);
var form = document.getElementById('form');

uploader.on('start', function(fileInfo) {
	console.log('Start uploading', fileInfo);
});
uploader.on('stream', function(fileInfo) {
	console.log('Streaming... sent ' + fileInfo.sent + ' bytes.');
});
uploader.on('complete', function(fileInfo) {
	console.log('Upload Complete', fileInfo);
});
uploader.on('error', function(err) {
	console.log('Error!', err);
});
uploader.on('abort', function(fileInfo) {
	console.log('Aborted: ', fileInfo);
});

form.onsubmit = function(ev) {
	ev.preventDefault();
	
	var fileEl = document.getElementById('file');
	var uploadIds = uploader.upload(fileEl, {
		data: { /* Arbitrary data... */ }
	});
};
```

Also Socket.io-file-client supports UMD, you can load from CommonJS require() or ES6 import:

```javascript
import SocketIO from 'socket.io-client';
import SocketIOFileClient from 'socket.io-file-client';
```

TypeScript is also supported with typings:

```typescript
import * as SocketIO from 'socket.io-client';
import { SocketIOFileClient } from 'socket.io-file-client';
```

```javascript
var socket = SocketIO('http://localhost:3000');
var uploader = new SocketIOFileClient(socket);
var form = document.getElementById('form');

uploader.on('start', (fileInfo) => {
	console.log('Start uploading', fileInfo);
});
uploader.on('stream', (fileInfo) => {
	console.log('Streaming... sent ' + fileInfo.sent + ' bytes.');
});
uploader.on('complete', (fileInfo) => {
	console.log('Upload Complete', fileInfo);
});
uploader.on('error', (err) => {
	console.log('Error!', err);
});
uploader.on('abort', (fileInfo) => {
	console.log('Aborted: ', fileInfo);
});

form.onsubmit = function(ev) {
	ev.preventDefault();
	
	var fileEl = document.getElementById('file');
	var uploadIds = uploader.upload(fileEl);
};
```


## API
### constructor SocketIOFileClient(io socket, Object options)
Create new SocketIOFileClient object.

### Array SocketIOFileClient.upload(HTMLElement fileEl, Object options)
### Array SocketIOFileClient.upload(FileList files, Object options) (New from 2.0.1)
Upload file(s). First argument must be <input type="file" /> or FileList object, other wise refuse uploads. If it has multiple files(with multiple attribute), it uploads all at once.
Returns array that contains upload ids as values.
Available options are:
- String to: If server has multiple upload directories, client must be set the directory where to upload.
- Object data: An arbitrary data object that will be passed to the server side events.

### SocketIOFileClient SocketIOFileClient.on(String evName, function fn)
Attach event handler to SocketIOFileClient. Possible events are described later part.

### SocketIOFileClient SocketIOFileClient.off(String evName[, function fn])
Detach event handler from SocketIOFileClient. If function is undefined, removes all event handlers attached on that event.

### SocketIOFileClient SocketIOFileClient.emit(String evName, Object args)
Trigger the event.

### void SocketIOFileClient.abort(String id)
Abort upload of specified id.

### void SocketIOFileClient.destroy(void)
Destroy all resources about SocketIOFileClient. Use this method for saving more resources from client side. After use this, you can't upload file anymore.

### void SocketIOFileClient.getUploadInfo(void) 
Get array of currently uploading files. Keys are upload id, values are object that contains information of uploading files.

### bool SocketIOFileClient.isDestroyed (ADDED 2.0.2)
Returns true after destroyed by calling destroy method or server force to close.


### Events
SocketIOFile provides these events. Some of property is slight different than servers, like wrote -> sent.

#### ready (ADDED ON 2.0.12)
Fired on ready to upload files. Everytime you create new SocketIOFileClient object, it receives some upload information from server like chunkSize, mimeType like other things.
So if you send the file before sync those meta data, your upload won't work properly. Personally, I recommend create single SocketIOFileClient object first, and make upload after ready events fired.


#### disconnected (ADDED ON 2.0.2)
Fired when server forcely send disconnect order. After it fires, you can't send file via socket.io-file.

### loadstart (ADDED ON 2.0.13)
Fired right before load the file from browser. After browser load the file you selected, it will start uploading and trigger "start" event.

### progress (ADDED ON 2.0.13)
Keep firing while browser load your file. This will help to implement loading system that how much data loaded before send.
- Number loaded: Bytes of loaded
- Number total: Total byts of file

#### start
Fired on starting file upload. This means server grant your uploading request and create empty file to begin writes. Argument has:
- String name: Name of the file
- Number size: Size of the file(bytes)
- String uploadTo: Directory that where to writing.
- Object data: The arbitrary data object that was passed to the upload()-function.

#### stream
Fired on getting chunks from client. Argument has:
- String name
- String uploadTo
- Number size
- Number sent: Bytes of sent
- Object data: The arbitrary data object that was passed to the upload()-function.

#### complete
Fired on upload complete. Argument has:
- String name
- String mime: MIME type that server recognized.
- Number size
- Number wrote
- Number estimated: Estimated uploading time as ms.
- Object data: The arbitrary data object that was passed to the upload()-function.

#### abort
Fired on abort uploading.
- String name
- String uploadTo
- Number size
- Number sent
- Object data: The arbitrary data object that was passed to the upload()-function.

#### error
Fired on got an error.
- First argument: Error object.
- Second argument: Object with the following properties: 
	- String uploadId 
	- String name 
	- Number size
	- String type
	- String uploadTo
	- Object data: The arbitrary data object that was passed to the upload()-function.


## FAQ
### Upload 0 bytes
Try to upload after "ready" event fired.


## Browser Supports
This module uses FileReader API with ArrayBuffer, so make sure your browser support it.
